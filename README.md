# Project 1:  Data Modeling with Postgres
## Overview 
In this project, we apply Data Modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. A startup wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. Currently, they are collecting data in json format and the analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

# Project 2:  Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
## Overview 
In this project, we apply Data Modeling with Cassandra and build an ETL pipeline using Python. A startup wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. Currently, they are collecting data in json format and the analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.
Data is modeled in the table and the sequence and order in which data is partitioned, inserted and retrieved from the table is optimized for certain queries to be run on the Cassandra DB.
